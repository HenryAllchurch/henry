            <h2>Papers</h2>
            <p>Commencing 21st of September a paperound will be starting. 
                Pay: 15c Per newspaper delivered (an extra 2,3 or 5 cents included for extra flyers)
                Quantity: 250
                <p> Info:
                    Deliverers are required to pick up the newspaper from the Hollywood Bowling Club (car park off Verdun Street, Nedlands) any time after 4.00am morning on a Friday.  I am there between 4.00-7.00am every Friday if deliverers need to see me regarding any problems.  I request that the first time a new deliverer comes and meets me during this time to complete paperwork and familiarise - after the first time deliverers can come at their convenience.  The newspaper is a Friday/Saturday delivery and I do request that all deliveries are completed by no later than Saturday pm.

                    We deliver to all residential letterboxes (unless signage "No Newspapers") as we consider the newspaper a community service and not junk mail.  Newspaper must be placed into letterboxes/tubes wherever possible - if cannot fit then must be elastic banded (provided) and placed on top or beside the letterbox - under no circumstances is the newspaper to be thrown.
                    
                    Plastic sleeves are provided during the winter months so the newspaper can be placed into and not get wet - this would only apply to where the newspaper cannot fit into letterboxes/tubes.
                    
                    Deliverers are required to find their own replacements should they go on holidays â€“ I can cope with the odd week but cannot keep areas vacant for any lengthy period of time.
                    
                    Deliverers are paid 15 cents per paper - if there is a mechanical insert then deliverers are paid an extra 2, 3 or 5 cents depending on the size and whether it is a flyer or catalogue.
                    
                    Payment is made every Tuesday by electronic transfer into your bank account.
